This repository contains selected material from a set of programming notes written as part of an undergraduate Programming for Physics course, and expanded independently to consolidate understanding of computational methods used in physics.

The notes focus on Python and commonly used scientific libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, with applications to numerical modelling, data analysis, and visualisation.

A short preview from the beginning of the notes is included here. Due to file size constraints, the complete notes are hosted externally and are accessible via the link provided.
